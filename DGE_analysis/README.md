Differential gene expression was analyzed, visualized and compared to population divergence metrics using a targets pipeline. All functions implemented in the targets pipeline (`_targets.R`) can be found in `Tcon_CF_DGE_continental_funcs.R`. Final figures or component panels were generated in as described in `MS_HostShiftGeneExpression_makeFigures.Rmd` and formatted as necessary using Inkscape.
